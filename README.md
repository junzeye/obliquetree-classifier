Oblique Decision Tree in Python

</div>

## Introduction

The oblique decision tree is a popular choice in the machine learning domain for improving the performance of traditional decision tree algorithms. In contrast to the traditional decision tree, which uses an axis-parallel split point to determine whether a data point should be assigned to the left or right branch of a decision tree, the oblique decision tree uses a hyper-plane based on all data point features. 

Numerous works in the machine learning domain have shown that oblique decision trees can achieve exceptional performance in a wide range of domains. However, there is still a lack of a package that has implemented oblique decision tree algorithms, which stymies the development of this domain. As a result, the goal of this project is to solve this problem by implementing some well-known algorithms in this domain. We hope that by doing so, these algorithms will serve as a baseline for machine learning practitioners to compare newly designed algorithms to existing algorithms.


## ðŸš€ Features
* A simple scikit-learn interface for oblique classification tree algorithms

## Example
Example of usage:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, StratifiedKFold, GridSearchCV, cross_val_score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from HHCART import HouseHolderCART  # oblique tree classifier
from segmentor import Gini, TotalSegmentor  # module to determine splits
import numpy as np
import itertools, time

# Load training data - we use the Iris dataset as an example
X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state = 1)

# Initialize an HHCART classifier object
sgmtr = TotalSegmentor()
HHTree = HouseHolderCART(impurity = Gini(), segmentor = sgmtr, max_depth = 5, 
                                    min_samples = 4)
# max_depth: maximum depth of the decision tree. 
# min_samples: minimum allowed number of samples in a terminal node

# Train the classifier
HHTree.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the classifier performance
train_score = accuracy_score(y_train, HHTree.predict(x_train))
test_score = accuracy_score(y_test, HHTree.predict(x_test))
print(f"train accuracy: {train_score:.00%}")
print(f"test accuracy: {test_score:.00%}")
```
