Oblique Decision Tree in Python

</div>

## Introduction

The oblique decision tree is a popular choice in the machine learning domain for improving the performance of traditional decision tree algorithms. In contrast to the traditional decision tree, which uses an axis-parallel split point to determine whether a data point should be assigned to the left or right branch of a decision tree, the oblique decision tree uses a hyper-plane based on all data point features. 

Numerous works in the machine learning domain have shown that oblique decision trees can achieve exceptional performance in a wide range of domains. However, there is still a lack of a package that has implemented oblique decision tree algorithms, which stymies the development of this domain. As a result, the goal of this project is to solve this problem by implementing some well-known algorithms in this domain. We hope that by doing so, these algorithms will serve as a baseline for machine learning practitioners to compare newly designed algorithms to existing algorithms.


## ðŸš€ Features
* A simple scikit-learn interface for oblique classification tree algorithms

## Example
Example of usage:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from HHCART import HouseHolderCART
from segmentor import Gini, TotalSegmentor

X, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)
reg = BaggingRegressor(
    HouseHolderCART(Gini(), TotalSegmentor(), max_depth=5),
    n_estimators=100,
    n_jobs=-1,
)
print('CV Score', cross_val_score(reg, X, y))
```
